Deep Multiple Kernel Learning by Span Bound
=======

This is the method described in Strobl EV, Visweswaran S. Deep Multiple Kernel Learning. ICMLA, 2013. The method optimizes a deep multiple kernel net by alternating optimization with the span bound. It is an attempt to extend deep learning to small sample sizes.
