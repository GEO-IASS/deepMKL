Description
---

This is an algorithm that optimizes a deep multiple kernel net by alternating optimization with the span bound. It is an attempt to extend deep learning to small sample sizes.

The algorithm is described in detail in Strobl EV, Visweswaran S. Deep Multiple Kernel Learning. ICMLA, 2013. http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3101
